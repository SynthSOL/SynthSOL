## Example Usage

After PumpFun Token integration, developers can use the Synth Framework with PFT:

```python
response = framework.execute_AI_query(
    model_id="example-model",
    query_payload={"prompt": "Generate text based on Solana."},
    token_address="PumpFunTokenAddress",
    user_keypair_path="path/to/user-keypair.json"
)
print(f"AI Response: {response}")
```
