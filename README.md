# Synth Framework

**A Solana-based AI framework for integrating and deploying decentralized AI solutions directly on-chain.**

Synth Framework leverages Solanaâ€™s high-speed and low-cost infrastructure to power real-time AI applications in a decentralized, scalable, and cost-effective manner.

## Overview

Synth Framework empowers developers to:
- Deploy and interact with **AI models** using Solanaâ€™s decentralized blockchain.
- Execute **tokenized AI queries** with minimal costs via $SOL or SPL tokens.
- Access **real-time data oracles** for AI computations.
- Share and monetize datasets in a **training data marketplace**.
- Build hybrid workflows combining on-chain and off-chain AI solutions.

Whether youâ€™re creating predictive models, generative AI applications, or AI-powered bots, Synth Framework provides the tools you need.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before installing, ensure you have:
1. **Python 3.7 or higher** installed on your system.
2. Dependencies for Solana integration:
   ```bash
   pip install solana
   ```

### Installing Synth Framework
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SynthSOL/SynthSOL.git
   cd synth-framework
   ```

2. Install the framework:
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize the Framework
Start by importing and initializing the framework:
```python
from synth_framework import SynthFramework

# Initialize Synth Framework
framework = SynthFramework("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com")
```

### 2. Fetch Account Information
Retrieve detailed information about a Solana account:
```python
account_info = framework.get_account_info("YourPublicKeyHere")
print(account_info)
```

### 3. Create a New Account
Create a new Solana account using an existing payer account:
```python
new_account = framework.create_account("path/to/payer-keypair.json", space=0)
print(f"New account created: {new_account.public_key}")
```

### 4. Transfer SOL
Send SOL from one account to another:
```python
transaction_signature = framework.transfer_SOL(
    "path/to/sender-keypair.json",
    "RecipientPublicKeyHere",
    1000000  # Amount in lamports (1 SOL = 1,000,000 lamports)
)
print(f"Transaction successful: {transaction_signature}")
```

### 5. Execute AI Query
Interact with AI models hosted on Solana:
```python
response = framework.execute_AI_query(
    model_id="example-model",
    query_payload={"prompt": "Generate text based on Solana."},
    token_address="TokenAddressHere",
    user_keypair_path="path/to/user-keypair.json"
)
print(f"AI Response: {response}")
```

## Full Deployment Announcement

ðŸŽ‰ **Synth Frameworkâ€™s full deployment is scheduled for January 5, 2025.** ðŸŽ‰

With this release, you can:
- Deploy and execute advanced AI models on-chain.
- Use the training data marketplace for data sharing and monetization.
- Access enhanced developer tools to streamline AI application development.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have sufficient $SOL for transaction fees in the payer account.
- Verify that your keypair files are in JSON format and valid.
- Use a stable internet connection to access the Solana RPC endpoint.

## PumpFun Token Integration

**Planned Token Integration with the Synth Framework**

The upcoming **PumpFun Token (PFT)** launch will be integrated with the Synth Framework to enhance tokenized AI interactions and provide new utility for developers and users. PumpFun Token is designed to facilitate and incentivize AI operations within the Synth ecosystem.

---

## Features of PumpFun Token Integration

1. **Tokenized AI Queries**
   - Use PumpFun Tokens to pay for AI model interactions.
   - Enjoy discounted rates for AI queries when using PFT.

2. **Incentivized Data Sharing**
   - Reward users with PFT for contributing high-quality datasets to the training data marketplace.

3. **On-Chain Staking**
   - Stake PumpFun Tokens to gain premium access to AI features and priority query processing.

4. **Marketplace Transactions**
   - Use PumpFun Tokens for transactions within the training data marketplace, enabling a seamless ecosystem.

---

## Roadmap for Integration

- **Q1 2025:** Initial PumpFun Token launch with basic utility for tokenized AI queries.
- **Q2 2025:** Introduce staking mechanisms and incentivized data sharing.
- **Q3 2025:** Full marketplace integration for data and model transactions.

---

## Example Usage

After PumpFun Token integration, developers can use the Synth Framework with PFT:

```python
response = framework.execute_AI_query(
    model_id="example-model",
    query_payload={"prompt": "Generate text based on Solana."},
    token_address="PumpFunTokenAddress",
    user_keypair_path="path/to/user-keypair.json"
)
print(f"AI Response: {response}")
```
