# Synth Framework

**A Solana-based AI framework for integrating and deploying decentralized AI solutions directly on-chain.**

Synth Framework leverages Solanaâ€™s high-speed and low-cost infrastructure to power real-time AI applications in a decentralized, scalable, and cost-effective manner.

## Overview

Synth Framework empowers developers to:
- Deploy and interact with **AI models** using Solanaâ€™s decentralized blockchain.
- Execute **tokenized AI queries** with minimal costs via $SOL or SPL tokens.
- Access **real-time data oracles** for AI computations.
- Share and monetize datasets in a **training data marketplace**.
- Build hybrid workflows combining on-chain and off-chain AI solutions.

Whether youâ€™re creating predictive models, generative AI applications, or AI-powered bots, Synth Framework provides the tools you need.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before installing, ensure you have:
1. **Python 3.7 or higher** installed on your system.
2. Dependencies for Solana integration:
   ```bash
   pip install solana
   ```

### Installing Synth Framework
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SynthSOL/synthSOL.git
   cd synth-framework
   ```

2. Install the framework:
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize the Framework
Start by importing and initializing the framework:
```python
from synth_framework import SynthFramework

# Initialize Synth Framework
framework = SynthFramework("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com")
```

### 2. Fetch Account Information
Retrieve detailed information about a Solana account:
```python
account_info = framework.get_account_info("YourPublicKeyHere")
print(account_info)
```

### 3. Create a New Account
Create a new Solana account using an existing payer account:
```python
new_account = framework.create_account("path/to/payer-keypair.json", space=0)
print(f"New account created: {new_account.public_key}")
```

### 4. Transfer SOL
Send SOL from one account to another:
```python
transaction_signature = framework.transfer_SOL(
    "path/to/sender-keypair.json",
    "RecipientPublicKeyHere",
    1000000  # Amount in lamports (1 SOL = 1,000,000 lamports)
)
print(f"Transaction successful: {transaction_signature}")
```

### 5. Execute AI Query
Interact with AI models hosted on Solana:
```python
response = framework.execute_AI_query(
    model_id="example-model",
    query_payload={"prompt": "Generate text based on Solana."},
    token_address="TokenAddressHere",
    user_keypair_path="path/to/user-keypair.json"
)
print(f"AI Response: {response}")
```

## Full Deployment Announcement

ðŸŽ‰ **Synth Frameworkâ€™s full deployment is scheduled for January 5, 2025.** ðŸŽ‰

With this release, you can:
- Deploy and execute advanced AI models on-chain.
- Use the training data marketplace for data sharing and monetization.
- Access enhanced developer tools to streamline AI application development.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have sufficient $SOL for transaction fees in the payer account.
- Verify that your keypair files are in JSON format and valid.
- Use a stable internet connection to access the Solana RPC endpoint.
